# Core BTS DevOps Primer

This repository is intended to be an interactive location for providing a series of modules as a course to ramp up on DevOps. The expectation is that someone completing this course is experienced in Microsoft Azure. 

As this course evolves, modules will be updated to right-size difficulty and ensure content is up-to-date.

Course materials can be found in the [Course Materials](/course-material/) folder.
