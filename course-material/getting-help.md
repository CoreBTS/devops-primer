# How to Get Help

As part of beginning the course, reach out to Alex and / or Paul to confirm the preferential form of communication. 

Typically an email with a descriptive subject, such as "Azure Training - &lt;Issue Description Here&gt;" is effective in notifying the course leaders and getting a timely response. The more details the better and approach asking for assistance as if you were working with a client team (screenshots, code snippets, due dilligence, etc. is appreciated). Depending on the issue, a working session may be scheduled by the course leaders to assist with resolution.
